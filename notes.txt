* Bayess optimal decision boundaries and accuracy - synthetic data is Gaussian
  - 0.69 for sigma=1 and 2classes
  - 0.73 for sigma=0.8
  - 0.59 for sigma=1 and 3classes
  - 0.65 for sigma=0.8 and 3classes

- cross-validation is not necessary for evaluation of label propagation - just pick the best performing params on the validation set (train_propagation) - this should be unbiased since i am not using it in the training - and hope that it performs well on the test set

- adapt test/validation evaluation to cases where only a fraction of the data is labelled!

- label!
