\cite{PLZ07} Automatic image analysis for gene expression patterns of fly embryos
 - they search for clusters of genes with similar expression patterns 
 - graph-based clustering
 - image similarity


Clustering-based methodology with minimal user supervision for displaying cell-phenotype signatures in image-based screening
 - they select representatives
 - clustering of different Golgi phenotypes


Automatic Mining of Fruit Fly Embryo Images
 - ISH Drosophila embryo images
 - SVM and k-NN to recognize different annotation classes based on PCA and ICA projections
