    """
    Propagates binary labels in a graph specified by weights.

    Minimizes:
    .. math::
        \|S\hat{Y}-SY\|^2 + \mu\hat{Y}^TL\hat{Y} + \mu\eps\|\hat{Y}\|^2

    by solving:
    .. math::
        (S + \muL + \mu\eps{}I)\hat{Y} * SY = 0  

    where Y and Y hat are known and fitted labels, S is a diagonal matrix with
    S[i,i] = 1 if Y[i] is known and 0 otherwise, L is a graph Laplacian. For
    more information consult [1].

    Parameters:
    ===========
    weights: 2D float ndarray
        Weights of the edges between samples.
    labels: list/array
        Labels for all samples. Labels should be -1, or 1 for the two classes, 0 for unknown.
    confidences: float list/array
        Confidences of the assigned labels, 0 for unknown, 1 for known.
    mu: float
        Smoothness weight.
    eps: float
        Regularization weight.

    Returns:
    ========
    probability
        Probability of the positive class
