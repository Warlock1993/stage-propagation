Embryo staging experiment
=========================

This is the embryo staging experiment from the paper:
  Kazmar T, Kvon EZ, Stark A, Lampert CH. Drosophila Embryo Stage
  Annotation using Label Propagation. International Conference on
  Computer Vision (ICCV), 2013.

The features: embryo shape (*-feats.csv.gz) and pattern similarity
(*-dissim.csv.gz) are precomputed to avoid distribution of the original image
data (>50GB). However, we are happy to share the data it with interested
people.  If you are interested, please, contact us: tomas.kazmar@imp.ac.at

For data file description, refer to README coming with the source code.

Replicating the results:
  1. Create Makefile.local from the template Makefile.local.example
  2. Setup the SRC_BASE variable in Makefile to point to the source code
  3. Train the classifier by:
    make cl-train
  3. Train the propagation by:
    make pr-train
  4. Finally test the performance by:
    make test
  5. Check reported accuracies by:
    cat pr*.txt

  To use multiple cores setup the N_JOBS variable in Makefile.local and also run
  the commands above as:

  make -j your_number_of_cores cl-train
  make -j your_number_of_cores pr-train
  make -j your_number_of_cores test

  If everything worked as expected, you should receive results comparable to the
  paper, ie., something like:

  Sample accuracy: 0.706, label accuracy: 0.672, set accuracy: 0.718
  Sample accuracy: 0.825, label accuracy: 0.680, set accuracy: 0.812
